# Unsupervised Learning : K-Means Clustering

In this repository, K-means Clustering algorithm has been implemented from scratch (without using any external libraries) using Python in Jupyter Notebook with two different 
*centroid initialization* strategies:

* **Strategy 1:** Randomly picking initial centers from the given samples
* **Strategy 2:** Choosing points farthest from the previously chosen centers
